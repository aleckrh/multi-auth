This package gives you the ability to separate user areas in your application. 

E.g, an ecommerce application with customers, sellers, and administrators user areas using [auth guards](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authentication#adding-custom-guards)

## Older versions

We've switched from [`laravel/ui`](https://github.com/laravel/ui) to [`laravel/breeze`](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) and adopted a modular approach.

Each user group will be setup in a dedicated modules dir, e.g `app/Modules/Admin`.

For old versions (Laravel v9 and below) refer to [v11](https://github.com/mtvbrianking/multi-auth/tree/11.x)

## Prerequisite

This package only extends the official `laravel/breeze` starter kit, it doesn't regenerate the frontend assets [js, css - tailwind, vite, ...]

Therefore, you need to use it after scaffolding basic auth using Breeze.

## Installation

```bash
composer require bmatovu/multi-auth --dev
```

## Scaffolding

```bash
php artisan multi-auth:install {guard}
```

## Register service provider

> config/app.php

```diff
  'providers' => [
      /*
      * Package Service Providers...
      */
+     App\Modules\Admins\AdminServiceProvider::class,
  ],
```
## Rebuild JS, CSS resources to Vite (Inertia - Vue, React)

```diff
  export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
          laravel({
-             input: 'resources/js/app.js',
+             input: [
+                 'resources/js/app.js',
+                 'resources/js/Admins/app.js',
+             ],
-             ssr: 'resources/js/ssr.js',
+             ssr: [
+                 'resources/js/ssr.js',
+                 'resources/js/Admins/ssr.js',
+             ],
              refresh: true,
          }),
          ...
      ],
  });
```

## Possible approaches for separating user areas

### Using sub-domains

Separate user areas by sub-domains.

_I would use separate repos for each sub-domain_

| URI | User Group |
| ---- | ---- |
| larastore.com | customers |
| seller.larastore.com | sellers |
| admin.larastore.com | administrators |

### Using URLs\*

_Separate user areas based on URLs. Restricted with auth guards_

\* What this package offers

| URI | User Group |
| ---- | ---- |
| larastore.com | customers |
| larastore.com/seller | sellers |
| larastore.com/admin | administrators |

### Using roles

Restrict access based on the user's roles and permissions

_I'd stay away from this approach as it'd more complex to maintain for large projects_

| URI | User Group |
| ---- | ---- |
| larastore.com | customers, sellers, administrators |
